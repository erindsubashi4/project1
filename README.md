This report is for online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. I need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow me to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.
In front of me is data going back to 2016. (The important thing is to get experience working with data. It doesn't really matter whether you're forecasting 2017 sales based on data from 2016 or 2027 sales based on data from 2026.)
The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature.
